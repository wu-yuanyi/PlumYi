# PlumYi
    梅花易是一种传统的中国易术。古代的中国人用它来预测短期和中期的命运。我的一个长辈教了一些简单的梅花易，我已经写了梅花易的主要代码。剩下的部分如果我有时间我会补完。关于卦辞的解释还是中文的，有空我也会整理出一个英文版。
    中国的传统是算命会损耗运气，我帮别人算命确实会倒霉，大家慎用。
    
  PlumYi(plum Yi) is a tradional Chinese forecast.The ancient Chinese people use it to predict the fate of the short and medium term. One of my elders taught me a little about PlumYi, and I have finished the main code of it. I will finish it when I have enough time. And I will translate the explain of result  to English too.
    
  Chinese people believe that disclose the secret of god will get you in trouble. So if you want to use it, you should be careful. After I use it to predicte for my friends, I got some trouble.
